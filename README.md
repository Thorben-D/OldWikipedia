Recently, Wikipedia have changed their layout drastically.
<br>
While this change apparently made the layout more inclusive, I strongly dislike it.
<br>
I have a 21:9 ("ultrawide") screen, which I very much enjoy using for reading.
<br>
Unfortunately, the new designs margins look borderline ridiculous on that screen.

For now, simply appending <i><b>?useskin=vector</b></i> to any Wikipedia-url reverts it's layout back to the old one.

I suspect that this option will not be available forever and will update the plugins when the time comes.
